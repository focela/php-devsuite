# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment, including stalking, intimidation, or repeated unwanted contact
- Publishing private information (such as addresses, phone numbers, or emails) without explicit permission
- Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities of Project Maintainers

Project maintainers are responsible for defining and enforcing acceptable behavior and must take fair and consistent action in response to violations. They have the right to:

- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, or other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.
- Temporarily or permanently ban contributors for behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Decisions regarding enforcement must be transparent, and project maintainers must provide an explanation for their actions when reasonable.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual represents the project or its community. Representation includes:

- Using an official project email address
- Posting via an official social media account
- Acting as an appointed representative at online or offline events
- Participating in project-related discussions, including GitHub issues, pull requests, and forums

Project maintainers may further define specific boundaries of representation.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at **opensource@focela.com**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Reports will be handled confidentially, and complainants will not face retaliation for making a report. The project team will determine an appropriate response, which may include:

1. A private warning to the offender
2. Temporary suspension from participation in project discussions
3. Permanent ban from the project

Repeated or severe violations may result in more serious consequences, including removal from leadership roles or legal action.
